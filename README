Survey Droid Project README
---------------------------

Social science research has traditionally required data that is difficult to gather; by using smartphones as data collection tools we can overcome the methodological limitations that have hampered social science research and kept important questions from being answered.

Survey Droid solves this by offering researches a fully customizable system for gathering information for just about any population.  The system consists of an Android app and a web iterface to control it.  The Android application is capable of tracking location, calls, and incoming texts.  Most importantly, it displays fully customizable surveys that adapt to pevious answers.  The simple web-based front-end allows researchers to create surveys, control study options, download information, monitor subject participation, and access communications sent by participants. All together, this is a powerful tool for social science researchers, enabling them to conduct useful, targeted, and inexpensive research on almost any population.  Best of all, it completely free and open source!
