-----------------------

Social Science research has traditionally required data that is difficult to
gather; by using smartphones as data collection tools we can overcome the
methodological limitations that have hampered social science research and kept
important questions from being answered. We will design an open source Android
application that will be distributed to over 100 reentering prisoners to track
their job-search experience. The application will enable: collection of
location-based data, collection of anonymized phone call information,
distribution of short questionnaires to study participants, contact between
study participants and researchers through audio or video messages. We aim to
create an application that will outlive the initial study and that is general
enough to allow other researchers to use it. We will design a simple web-based
front-end that will allow researchers to download information, monitor subject
participation, and access communications sent by participants. All together,
this will be a powerful tool for sociologists, enabling them to conduct useful,
targeted, and inexpensive research on almost any population.
