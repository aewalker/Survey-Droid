/**
 * @class Ext.grid.plugin.DragDrop
 * <p>This plugin provides drag and/or drop functionality for a GridView.</p>
 * <p>It creates a specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone} which knows how to drag out of a {@link Ext.grid.View GridView}
 * and loads the data object which is passed to a cooperating {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone}'s methods with the following properties:<ul>
 * <li>copy : Boolean
 *  <div class="sub-desc">The value of the GridView's <code>copy</code> property, or <code>true</code> if the GridView was configured
 *  with <code>allowCopy: true</code> <u>and</u> the control key was pressed when the drag operation was begun.</div></li>
 * <li>view : GridView
 *  <div class="sub-desc">The source GridView from which the drag originated.</div></li>
 * <li>ddel : HtmlElement
 *  <div class="sub-desc">The drag proxy element which moves with the mouse</div></li>
 * <li>item : HtmlElement
 *  <div class="sub-desc">The GridView node upon which the mousedown event was registered.</div></li>
 * <li>records : Array
 *  <div class="sub-desc">An Array of {@link Ext.data.Model Model}s representing the selected data being dragged from the source GridView.</div></li>
 * </ul></p>
 * <p>It also creates a specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DropZone} which cooperates with other DropZones which are members of the same
 * ddGroup which processes such data objects.</p>
 * <p>Adding this plugin to a view means that two new events may be fired from the client GridView, <code>{@link #event-beforedrop beforedrop}</code> and
 * <code>{@link #event-drop drop}</code></p>

     * View's Store to the destination View's Store.</p>
     * <p>This is useful when you want to perform some kind of asynchronous processing before confirming
     * the drop, such as an {@link Ext.window.MessageBox#confirm confirm} call, or an Ajax request.</p>
     * <p>Return <code>0</code> from this event handler, and call the <code>dropFunction</code> at any time to perform the data transfer.</p>
