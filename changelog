Survey Droid Changelog
----------------------
Version 0.6.1-beta:
	-Scheduling seems to be working better now.
	-Technical:
		-Switched SurveyScheduler to use id + time as the data uri.  Used 0 for the request code on all alarms.
		-Fixed a bug that caused the SurveyService to ignore timed surveys.
		-The BootIntentReciever does not run the scheduler; instead, it is run after a pull.

Version 0.6.0-beta:
	-Started keeping a changelog.
	-Surveys work much better:
	    -User-initiated surveys that are dismissed or time out are not reported at all.
	    -Notifications only show one survey at a time (the one that will time out soonest).
	    -Clearing the notification only cancels one survey.
	    -While a survey is active, the notification changes to reflect this.
	    -Clicking on a notification while a survey is running will return you to the survey if you have left it.
	    -Users are alerted multiple times when a survey is ready (default is every 10 minutes).
	    -After a survey is dismissed or completed, the next survey's alarm will fire.
	-Server communication is MUCH faster.
	-When a user presses the phone's physical back button in a survey, it will act just like pressing the on-screen back button.
	-Technical:
		-Mass database insert is implemented (responsible for communication speed increase).
		-Refresh rate and survey timeout in Config.java work a bit differently now
		-SurveyService almost totally rewritten; doesn't break old code but allows for new things such as timeout speed that is set on a per-survey basis.
		-The survey creation time is no longer shown in notifications while in debugging mode.
		-Added better comments/organization to strings.xml.
		-Deleted some deprecated files (stuff associated with the old notification system and the old end-of-survey sequence).
