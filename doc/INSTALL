PEOPLES Project Installation Guide
----------------------------------

PEOPLES has two parts: a web server and a set of Android smartphones.  Each
side of the system requires some setup.

To see the installation procedure for the web server software, see
doc/website-guide/install.html.  In particular, note that PEOPLES uses the
CakePHP framework.  If the web server on which you intend to install PEOPLES
already has other CakePHP applications running, see the section in the
installation guide about this for instructions on what parts of PEOPLES (which
is distributed with CakePHP) you need to install.

To see the installation procedure for the Android phones, see
doc/phone-guide/install.html.
