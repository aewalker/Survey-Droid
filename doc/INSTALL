Survey Droid Installation Guide
----------------------------------

The Survey Droid system has two parts: a web server and a set of Android
smartphones.  Each side of the system requires some setup.

To see the installation procedure for the web server software, see
doc/website-guide/install-web.html.  In particular, note that Survey Droid uses
the CakePHP framework.  If the web server on which you intend to install Survey
Droid already has other CakePHP applications running, see the section in the
installation guide about this for instructions on what parts of Survey Droid
(which is distributed with CakePHP) you need to install.

To see the installation procedure for the Android phones, see
doc/phone-guide/install-phone.html.
