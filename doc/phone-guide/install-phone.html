<h1>PEOPLES - Phone Installation Guide</h1>
<p>The PEOPLES application comes in a package called an APK, which is for Android what an EXE or MSI installer is for Windows and what a DMG is for Mac OS X.</p>
<p>The first step in the installation is acquiring the APK file, which can be downloaded from (insert link). You can do this in two ways: you can download it from your computer's browser, or you can type the link into your phone's browser and download it directly.</p>
<p>If you download it from your computer, you then have to copy the file to your phone through a USB cable, making sure to mount the phone's SD card from the USB icon in the phone's notification bar. Once you do so, you can then copy the file from your Downloads folder to the phone. After the file has been copied, unmount the phone from your computer and then also from the phone's notification icon. Finally, disconnect the USB cable.</p>
<p>If you download it from your phone, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>Once you have the application file on your phone, you will need a file manager to be able to browse to the file and install it. Chances are that your phone already has a file manager application installed, so check your app drawer to see whether this is the case.</p>
<p>If you don't have a file manager, you can acquire one from the Android Market, or you can direct your phone browser to http://www.lysesoft.com/products/andexplorer/AndExplorer.apk and click on the icon in the notification bar when the download is complete. Popular file managers in the Market include ASTRO, EStrongs, Linda File Manager, and AndExplorer - any one of these should work.</p>
<p>If you already have a file manager, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>Open your file manager and look for PEOPLES.apk - for the default phone browser, the file should be located in /sdcard/downloads. Once you locate the file, tap on it and select the install option (procedure may be slightly different depending on which file manager you're using). If that doesn't work, try long-pressing on it until a menu pops up, and tap on the install option.</p>
<p>You should now see a screen showing the application details, specifically the permissions that the app requires. These permissions are required for the various aspects of the app's functioning.</p>
<p>Once you have reviewed the information on this screen, press the Accept button and wait for the app to install. A confirmation screen should confirm the successful installation of the app, which will now appear in your app drawer.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you have just installed PEOPLES on your phone!</p>
